# Homeworks19-20
Back up of my written homeworks at the 1st year of Master's program at FMF UL.

## Notes
Some folders are not merely written up but also contain some sort of code, concretely
- the 1st and 2nd Group Theory homeworks both contain [GAP](https://www.gap-system.org) code,
- the 3rd Group Theory homework contains [Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/) code (since I'm too lazy to multiply matrices by hand),
- the 2nd homework for Commutative Algebra contains some [Macaulay 2](http://www2.macaulay2.com/Macaulay2/) and [Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/) code.
