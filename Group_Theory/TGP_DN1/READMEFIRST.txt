This document serves the purpose of orienting through the archive.

Firstly, tgp_nal1.pdf is merely the instructions file and does not need to be opened.
Secondly, as instructed, all input and output is located in terminal_view.txt. The
contents are a direct result of copying and pasting the contents of tgp_dn1.txt into
the gap terminal window (since my configuration does not let me read files directly).
Thirdly, if you wish to simply read the code into the gap interpreter you can do so
using tgp_dn1.g. This file is the same as the .txt one, merely the extentions differ.
