# Homeworks for Logic in CS class
Homeworks for Logic in Computer Science class are published as separate repositories.

## HW1: SAT solver
Our first homework was a collaborative project to build a SAT solver. It is located [here](https://github.com/bbencina/SAT_solver_logracHW) as there were other people involved.

## HW2: Lean
Our second homework was to prove various propersties and theorems regarding lists and vectors in the [Lean Theorem Prover](https://leanprover.github.io/). As a proper Lean project is itself a git repository, it is also separate and located [here](https://github.com/bbencina/SAT_solver_logracHW).
